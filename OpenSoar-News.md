# OpenSoar News

OpenSoar is built ON TOP of XCSoar: every OpenSoar version is the
current XCSoar master plus a small, well-defined stack of OpenSoar
additions (see `OpenSoar-AddOn.md` for the complete list of
differences).  This file therefore lists ONLY the OpenSoar additions
and changes per version - everything the XCSoar base brings along is
documented upstream in `NEWS.txt`.

House rule: as soon as a feature listed here is merged into XCSoar
itself, it stops being an OpenSoar item - it is removed from
`OpenSoar-AddOn.md` and future entries here simply ride along with the
XCSoar base.  Entries marked `[upstream PR]` are already submitted to
XCSoar and expected to disappear from this list.

The pre-7.45 history (OpenSoar 7.43/7.44 with its merge-based
bookkeeping) lives in the old repository and is not repeated here -
7.45.25 is the first release built with the rebase workflow.

## OpenSoar 7.45.25 - not released yet

Base: XCSoar master, state of 2026-08-27 (past the 7.45 feature set:
OpenGL rendering on all targets, upstream SkySight, reworked
data-file layout, PEV, dark mode, ...).

### Test versions

v7.45.25.t1 (first test version of the rebased OpenSoar)

* complete rebuild on current XCSoar master; all OpenSoar features
  below are re-applied as a clean patch stack on top
* devices
  - SteFly device family: RemoteStick (auto-detected on its own
    device slot, never occupying a user-configurable port) and
    RotaryPanel, incl. Manage dialog (Send/Receive/Restart)
  - Anemoi (RS-Flight) realtime wind driver
  - Becker AR62xx radio driver
  - FreeVario driver
* branding / user interface
  - OpenSoar name, graphics and icons on all screens; start screen
    shows the full version number prominently
  - test versions (vX.Y.Z.tN) use the red "testing" flavor including
    red application icons; releases are green
  - the "what's new" quick guide only appears when the XCSoar base
    version (major.minor) changes - not for every OpenSoar update
* fixes (also submitted to XCSoar)
  - CUPX waypoint archives: open in binary mode on Windows
    [upstream PR]
  - data-layout migration runs before the profile is loaded - no more
    silent settings loss on the first start after an upgrade
    [upstream PR]
  - quitting during startup exits with code 0 instead of an error
    code [upstream PR]
  - fix undefined behaviour when a terminal/grid widget grows from
    empty (port monitor crash on MSVC debug builds) [upstream PR]
* infrastructure
  - Windows: native CMake/MSVC build (Visual Studio 2022/2026),
    OpenGL-only; third-party libraries build automatically
  - GitHub CI: every release tag builds and publishes the Windows
    package automatically; testing tags become pre-releases
