OpenSoar - is an experimental fork of the wellknown gliding software XCSoar.

... and XCSoar is a tactical glide computer for Android, Linux, Mac OS X,
and Windows.

## Version lines

Version 7.44.24 closes the 7.44 line of OpenSoar; it receives no further
changes.  Development continues with OpenSoar 7.45.25, which carries the
same functionality but is rebuilt on top of the current XCSoar master, so
that the OpenSoar changes stay readable as a series of topics against
upstream.

This file is aimed at developers.  Developers should [read the (XCSoar-)
developer manual](https://xcsoar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Users can refer to the Users' Manual which, for the latest release, can be
downloaded via the [XCSoar home page](https://xcsoar.org/discover/manual.html).
