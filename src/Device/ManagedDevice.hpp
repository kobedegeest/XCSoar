/**
 * Base class for drivers that expose an async, block-oriented
 * settings-and-info exchange:
 *
 *   - the driver issues a "query" sentence (e.g. "$POPSQ,Settings*XX"),
 *   - the device responds with zero or more "field" sentences
 *     (e.g. "$PSRCS,R,Layout=2*XX"),
 *   - the device terminates the response with a "Ready" sentence
 *     (e.g. "$PSRCS,R,Ready*XX"), which unblocks the caller.
 *
 * Each block has its own #PendingBlock (Mutex + Cond + ready flag), so
 * the Info channel and the Settings channel are independent and can be
 * waited on in parallel without blocking each other.
 *
 * Two concrete consumers today: BlueFly Vario (legacy multi-sentence
 * BFV/BST/SET) and SteFly RemoteStick (PSRCI/PSRCS with explicit
 * "Ready" terminator). Future drivers with the same async R/W pattern
 * (XCVario settings, AR62xx, …) can drop in trivially.
 *
 * @note This class does NOT replace AbstractDevice's polymorphic
 *       ParseNMEA / LinkTimeout. Subclasses still override those.
 *       What it provides is a small reusable toolbox for the
 *       send-query / wait-for-block / write-setting choreography.
